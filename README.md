## Implementation

The implementation of the Corona Chat Bot project involved a combination of front-end web development using HTML and CSS, and back-end integration with Microsoft Azure services. To begin with, the website was designed using HTML and CSS to create an intuitive user interface. 

For the chatbot functionality, Microsoft Azure Bot Service was employed. This service enabled the creation of a chatbot that could interact with users, answer their queries, and provide COVID-19-related information. The chatbot was integrated with Azure QnA Maker, which served as the knowledge base for the bot. In QnA Maker, a comprehensive set of Questions and Answers were manually entered, ensuring accurate and informative responses from the chatbot. Additionally, prompts were created to enhance the chatbot's conversational flow and make it feel more human-like.

To host the website and deploy the chatbot, the Azure Storage Accounts feature was utilized. This allowed for seamless deployment and ensured the availability and scalability of the web application. By using Azure Portal, the necessary Azure services were accessed and configured, enabling a smooth development and deployment process.

Furthermore, Cognitive Services from Azure were integrated into the chatbot to enhance the user experience. These services provided advanced capabilities such as natural language understanding and sentiment analysis, allowing the chatbot to understand user queries more effectively and deliver accurate responses in a friendly manner.

Overall, the implementation of the Corona Chat Bot project involved leveraging HTML and CSS for website design, integrating with Microsoft Azure Bot Service and QnA Maker for chatbot functionality, hosting the website using Azure Storage Accounts, and incorporating Cognitive Services to enhance the user experience.

**Please Note**: A valid Azure account subscription is required to access and utilize the services provided by Microsoft Azure, including Azure Bot Service, Azure QnA Maker, Cognitive Services, and Azure Storage Accounts. An active subscription with the necessary permissions is required to configure and deploy projects on the Azure platform when I created the project.

## Project Disclaimer: For Demonstration Purposes Only

**Please Note**: The Corona Help Bot project is currently inactive due to the non-renewal of the Azure subscription. As a result, the website and chatbot services are not functional at this time. 

This GitHub repository has been created to showcase the implementation and features of the project. Screenshots of the project, when it was active, have been included to provide an overview of its functionality. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the utilization of Azure services for creating a chatbot-based website and to showcase the integration of Microsoft Azure Bot Service, Azure QnA Maker, Cognitive Services, and Azure Storage Accounts.

Please be aware that the actual functioning of the chatbot and website is dependent on an active Azure subscription. The provided screenshots and project description serve as an example of the project's capabilities when the Azure services were active and accessible.

I recommend referring to the code and project structure in this repository as a reference or learning resource for creating similar projects utilizing Azure services. However, as mentioned before without an active Azure subscription, the website and chatbot service will not be functional.

I appreciate your understanding and encourage you to explore the project implementation and features as a showcase of Azure service integration.
